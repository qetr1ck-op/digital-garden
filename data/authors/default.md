I'm dad, husband, son, developer. Doing Javascript more than 10 years. Do I like it? - grab a coffee, catch me on a call and let's discuss how backbone.js and later on angular.js have been changed the web world. Why node.js was a relief and how it can be a nightmare. Why JS is a wild west and how TS is try to fix it. Why I hate React but enjoy work with Next.js. The reason why I not believe in TDD and why a visual testing is our breed and butter.
